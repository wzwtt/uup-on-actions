# UUP On Actions
This action can download Windows ISOs on Github server. 
Before running the action, you should create a download package on [UUP dump](https://uupdump.net/ ) and upload the zip file to the root folder of the repository.

**Notice**: There are some issues with the [downloader](https://github.com/wzwtt/uup-on-actions/blob/main/.github/workflows/uup-windows.yml) that runs on Windows. Features marked on the UUP dump as **Windows conventer only** are currently **unavailable** until I fix the issue. 

Pull requests are always welcome.
